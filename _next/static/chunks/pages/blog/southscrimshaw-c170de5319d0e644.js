By allowing myself to really believe the fiction that was being presented to me I was able to appreciate and see the characters not as fictitious illustrations but as complex organisms capable of experiencing fear, doubts, curiosity, love, pain, trauma. This game has it all and I really congratulate the developer for creating this handcrafted story in this beautiful packaged called South Scrimshaw. There are two flaws which I will mention. - The game includes a machine generated narrative voice over which I have no problems with, but I believe having a human actor would have carried the game to new heights. - The audio levels are not properly balanced. There are times in which I can hardly hear the narrator as a consequence of the background music being much too loud. During my playthrough I was tempted to pause the game and check the options to see if a volume slider was present. Ultimately I decided not to since doing so would have ruined my immersion which I was enjoying so much. At the time of writing I checked and indeed there are audio sliders in the options, but I would have been great to have nailed and hammered the audio levels right from the start."})]})})}}},function(e){e.O(0,[774,888,179],function(){return e(e.s=5645)}),_N_E=e.O()}]);
